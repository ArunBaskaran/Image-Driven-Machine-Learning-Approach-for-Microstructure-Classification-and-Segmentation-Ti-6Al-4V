# Image-Driven-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Microstructure-Classification-and-Segmentation-Ti-6Al-4V

The repository contains the following data:

* Raw Images: These are distributed across the folders Images and Images_v2 (because Github wouldn't allow more than a 1000 files in a sub-directory). Images has 1000 images and Images_v2 has 225 files. ## Do not treat one folder for training and the other for testing, as the images are not shuffled across classes. 

* Pre-trained weights: A set of pre-trained weights for this CNN has been provided in the Weights repository. 

* Source Code for an instance of the pipeline: A sense for the pipeline can be gained from this code. It first performs the classification step and then performs label-specific segmentation tasks.
