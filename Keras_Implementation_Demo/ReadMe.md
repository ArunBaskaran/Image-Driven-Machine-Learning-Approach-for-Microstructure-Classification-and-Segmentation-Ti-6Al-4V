The source code in *CNN_Demo_Keras.py* contains the following two implementations: 

* The full code trains the neural network using 1000 images and 100 images for validation, and tests the trained weights on a dataset of 125 images. 

* By commenting out the training part, one can simply load the trained weights and test it on a dataset. 

Care should be taken to ensure the correct filepaths for loading the images and weights
